#access all values except 5th and 10th values
#access all values except 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th values
#access all values except 2nd, 4th,and 6th
#access 2nd,5th, and 8th element by using logical values
#modify the value of 3rd element
#modify the value of 7th element
#add 3 more levels
#after adding levels modify the value of 8th element
#after adding levels modify the value of 10th element
#change order of levels
